# Calculator_C_Sharp
This is a simple calculator in C#, created by using WPF and XAML 

This simple program is built using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), which provides with a unified programming model for building line-of-business desktop applications on Windows. XAML is used for developing the user interface of the calculator and also allows for separation of model and view, which is a good architectural principle. 

The calculator functions are: multiplying, deviding, adding and substracting.
